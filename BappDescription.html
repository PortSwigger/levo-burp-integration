<p>Build OpenApi specs from Burp's traffic using Levo.ai. Also detect and classify the PII and annotate specs with the PII details.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> No actual traffic or sensitive data will be sent to Levo AI Saas.</p>

<p>How does that work?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bring up Levo's Satellite service locally using Docker compose.</li>
	<li>Turn on sending traffic to Levo in Burp using config menu.</li>
	<li>Start using Burp like you normally do. Extension sends the API traffic (only few valid content types are supported) to Levo's Satellite</li>
	<li>Levo's Satellite that's running locally will process the traffic, sends OpenApi specs to Levo's cloud service. You can view the specs in Levo's UI.</li>
	<li>PII detection also fully runs locally in Satellite and only the PII types are sent to Levo's cloud service. You can view the PII types in Levo's UI.</li>
	<li><strong>None of your API data is sent to Levo's cloud service. Only OpenApi specs are sent to Levo's cloud service.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>By default, OpenApi specs are built for all the traffic. You can limit the scope to target scopes only by enabling the option in the config menu.</p>

<p>By default, the traffic isn't sent to Levo. You can enable it using the config menu.</p>
